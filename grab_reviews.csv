The chatbot is useless and doesn't provide any helpful solutions. The riders also seem to be clueless about how the Grab e-wallet works, which is very frustrating.

So the 5 min wait time starts running even before they're there. The app let's the drivers utilize this to get a no show fee from you even when they've only been there 2 mins. Horrible.,

Why is the app not following my mobile language setting, instead using my GeoLocation? I don't read foreign languages, won't help in my ordering.

This app is so useless. Said to have assigned driver, driver cant commit to it and didnt inform me, wasted my time waiting until they eventually cancel it. Useless customer service which cant even allow transfer of grabpay wallet back to my bank as i transfer money back to grabpay just for the ride. All they said was ""oh the driver will be punished"" which we wouldnt even know if that is true. Might as well just dont provide this service if you cant commit?",
